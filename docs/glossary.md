# Glossary

Alphabetised one-line definitions for project-specific terms. Standard thermodynamic and mineralogical terms (Ellingham, liquidus, HKL) are included only where the project usage is specific enough to warrant a note.

---

**AlphaMELTS** — silicate equilibrium engine based on the MELTS thermodynamic framework; accessed via PetThermoTools or the `engines/alphamelts/run_alphamelts.command` binary. Authoritative for silicate liquidus diagnostics; diagnostic-only (no ledger mutation). See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**AtomLedger** — the canonical mol-native store for all simulator state (`simulator/accounting/ledger.py`). Every balance sheet entry is in mol. Kg numbers are external projections only. See [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md).

**Bakeout** — volatile recovery hold at moderate temperature (C0 campaign, 20–950 °C, hard vacuum). Removes H₂O, CO₂, S₂, CHNOPS. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**Branch One** — post-C4 route that skips selective Mg pyrolysis and runs full-scope MRE (C5 at max 2.5 V); higher electrical energy (2650–4050 kWh/t) and shorter electrode life (2–3×) vs Branch Two. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**Branch Two** — preferred post-C4 route: C4 Mg pyrolysis + limited C5 MRE (max 1.6 V) + C6 Mg thermite. Lower electrical energy (1200–2000 kWh/t), electrode life 5–10× vs Branch One. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C0** — volatile bakeout and nanophase Fe⁰ separation campaign. Mandatory for all feedstocks. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C0b** — optional mild oxidative P-cleanup hold (1180–1320 °C, pO₂ 3–15 mbar). Recommended default for all lunar feedstocks. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C2A** — alkali / SiO / Fe co-extraction campaign family; two variants: `C2A_continuous` (single adaptive ramp, Path A default) and `C2A_staged` (discrete holds with cool Na FeO-cleanup stage). Source: `data/setpoints.yaml`. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C2B** — pO₂-managed Fe pyrolysis (Path B); preserves CMAS glass in the melt. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml`. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C3 (C3_NA, C3_K)** — alkali metallothermic polish campaign family. Under the V1c JANAF refit, the surviving recipe is **C3_NA** (Na-only at the cool 1150 °C window); **C3_K** is refused by the S1b engine gate at any practical melt T (K/Fe crossover ~832 °C), and Cr/Ti targets are refused at C3 temperatures. Refused dispatches are recorded in `shuttle_refusal_history`. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml` §1 `C3:`. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C4** — selective Mg pyrolysis campaign (Branch Two preferred). Source: `data/setpoints.yaml`. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C5** — limited MRE under O₂ backpressure; Branch Two max 1.6 V targeting SiO₂ → Si metal. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml`. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**C6** — Mg thermite reduction (3Mg + Al₂O₃ → 3MgO + 2Al); V1c keeps the equilibrium default below the ~1573 °C Mg/Al crossover, with hotter operation requiring a kinetic/local-heating justification. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml`. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**Cleaned melt** — silicate-only melt after Stage 0 removes volatiles, salts, native metals, halides, sulfates, and perchlorates. The input to the C1–C6 extraction sequence. Corresponds to `process.cleaned_melt` in the `AtomLedger`. See [`docs/process-model.md`](process-model.md).

**CMAS glass** — Ca–Mg–Al–Si silicate glass preserved in the melt when SiO₂ is not extracted (Path B or early-tap). A product of the industrial-glass mode. See [`docs/recipe-playbook.md`](recipe-playbook.md).

**Condensation train** — staged condenser array downstream of the furnace duct: Stage 0 hot duct (1400–1600 °C), Stage 1 Fe condenser (1100–1400 °C), Stage 2 Cr oxide harvester (1100–1300 °C), Stage 3 SiO/silica zone (900–1200 °C), Stage 4 alkali/Mg cyclone (350–700 °C), Stage 5 dust filter, Stage 6 turbine-compressor, Stage 7 O₂ accumulator. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml` §2.

**Ellingham** — the underlying Ellingham–Richardson plot (ΔG_f° of oxides per mol O₂ vs T). In this project the word is used in two distinct senses: (1) the **oxygen-affinity ladder** read at fixed T, which tells you which metal can reduce which oxide (the operative concept for the alkali shuttle and C6 thermite); and (2) the **pressure-modified Ellingham**, which tells you how each oxide's dissociation threshold shifts under non-standard pO₂ with a species-specific slope `−1/n_M` (the operative concept for evolution at millibar / microbar / nanotorr overhead pressures). Evolution order is *not* read directly off either Ellingham sense — it is `P_eff = a_M × P_sat`, where Sense 2 sets `a_M` and the Antoine equation sets `P_sat`. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md) §"Two senses of 'Ellingham' in this project".

**FactSAGE / ChemApp** — archived/removed multiphase-equilibrium adapter. It is not a live backend in this checkout and explicit `factsage` selection fails loud. See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**Freeze-gate** — evaporation flux multiplier on `liquid_fraction(T)` that suppresses sub-liquidus evaporation. Default OFF (`freeze_gate.enabled: false` in `data/setpoints.yaml` §15); the default-on flip is deferred post-0.5.0 pending a blast-radius review across the recipe catalog. The plumbing (kernel intent `GATE_LIQUID_FRACTION`, MAGEMin liquid-fraction shadow, ThermoEngine activity threading) landed in 0.5.0 ready for the flip.

**HKL (Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir)** — the evaporation flux equation relating surface vapor pressure, temperature, and molecular weight to a kinetic evaporation rate. Implemented in `simulator/evaporation.py`. The simulator evaluates HKL once per tick at tick-start conditions and integrates depletion analytically within the tick.

**Hot wall** — upstream pipe and duct maintained above ~1400 °C to prevent premature condensation before vapor reaches its designated condenser stage. The design invariant that makes directional extraction possible. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**Knudsen number (Kn)** — `λ / L` where λ is mean-free-path and L is pipe diameter. Must be ≪ 0.01 (viscous-flow regime) for directional vapor transport. The 5–15 mbar pN₂ band is calibrated to maintain this. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**Knudsen-regime refusal** — whole-run halt emitted by F3's `KnudsenRegimeRefusal` when any pipe segment Kn ≥ 10 under a campaign that requires viscous flow. Reported on `run_metadata.knudsen_regime_diagnostic` (`status`, `regime`, per-segment array) and escalates the runner's top-level `status` to `"refused"`. The band-integration HKL flux also applies `regime_factor = Kn / (Kn + 0.01)` so under-pressure runs report a physics-honest attenuated yield rather than a free-molecular ceiling.

**Kress91** — the fO₂-coupled Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ melt redox model (Kress & Carmichael 1991). Not yet implemented; Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ partitioning is a diagnostic estimate only in current builds. See [`docs/model-limitations.md`](model-limitations.md).

**Liquidus** — temperature above which a melt is fully liquid; the upper boundary of the mush region. Below the liquidus, crystallisation begins on cooling. Relevant to the freeze-gate and to the C6 self-terminating criterion (liquidus > 1700 °C when residual SiO₂ + Al₂O₃ < 15–20 wt%).

**MAGEMin** — open-source Gibbs free-energy minimiser for silicate phase equilibria; shadow-only for `SILICATE_LIQUIDUS` and `SILICATE_EQUILIBRIUM`. Does not hold ledger authority. See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**MELTS** — thermodynamic framework for silicate melt and phase equilibrium; accessed via ThermoEngine or PetThermoTools. The activity convention is `a_i = exp((μ_i − μ_i0) / RT)`. See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**MRE** - molten regolith electrolysis; applies Nernst + Faraday electrolysis to reduce melt oxides at voltages from 0.39 V (NiO) / 0.75 V (FeO) to 2.5 V (CaO). The `MRE_BASELINE` track models full electrolysis without pyrolysis pretreatment. See [`docs/process-model.md`](process-model.md).

**MRE_BASELINE** — runner track for full molten regolith electrolysis without pyrolysis pretreatment; the comparison point for quantifying what pretreatment saves. Invoked via `--track=mre_baseline`.

**Mush** — partially molten temperature region between solidus and liquidus where melt and crystals coexist. Relevant to freeze-gate behavior and melt viscosity estimates.

**Overhead** — gas headspace above the melt; carries total pressure, partial pressures, and sweep gas composition. The `overhead_headspace.enabled` toggle (default OFF) controls whether evaporation O₂ is routed through `process.overhead_gas` before bleeding to terminal accounts. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml` §14.

**pN₂** — sweep gas partial pressure (canonical symbol — N₂, Ar, or CO₂ on Mars feedstocks); controls viscous-flow transport. Target band 5–15 mbar. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**pO₂** — oxygen partial pressure; the control lever for the SiO₂ ⇌ SiO + ½O₂ equilibrium and for selective oxide reduction via the Ellingham ladder. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**PetThermoTools** — Python API for alphaMELTS-family calculations; the preferred Python-side bridge to MELTS thermodynamics. Installed as an editable sibling clone by `install-engines.py`. See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**PySulfSat** — optional Python package for sulfur saturation calculations (SCSS via Smythe 2017, SCAS via Chowdhury & Dasgupta 2019). Gates the Stage 0 sulfur-saturation split when installed. See [`docs/process-model.md`](process-model.md).

**Residual floor** — the mass of melt that cannot be evaporated at survivable temperature; the physical source of the refractory ceramic rump. Ca, REE, TiO₂, and residual Al₂O₃ define the floor. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**Rump** — terminal refractory ceramic residue after full extraction sequence: Ca-rich, Al-residual, REE (0.5–1.0 wt%), Ti. Approximately 10–15 kg per tonne for a low-Ti mare feedstock after C6. Not a recipe choice — a physical floor from oxide stability. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**Shuttle** — Na/K loop that reduces target oxides metallothermically (Na + FeO → Na₂O + Fe is the surviving recipe post-V1c; the analogous K reaction is engine-refused) and recycles alkali back into the melt as O₂ is baked out. Dual role: oxygen reductant and selectivity tool. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md) §"The alkali shuttle".

**Shuttle refusal** — engine-level rejection of a metallothermic step when the dispatch-T thermodynamic margin is non-positive (S1b T-acceptance gate, post-V1c-JANAF). Each refusal is recorded as one entry in the runner output's `shuttle_refusal_history` with `campaign`, `hour`, `temperature_C`, and the engine's structured diagnostic. Per-step refusals leave the run `status` at `ok` or `partial`; only whole-run halts (e.g. `KnudsenRegimeRefusal`) escalate to `status="refused"`. See [`docs/runner-output-schema.md`](runner-output-schema.md).

**SiO suppression law** — `p(SiO) = K(T) × a(SiO₂) / √pO₂`; suppression factor ~300× conservative at 1 mbar pO₂ vs hard vacuum. Source: `data/setpoints.yaml:940`.

**Solidus** — temperature below which a melt is fully crystalline on cooling; the lower boundary of the mush region.

**Stage 0** — pretreatment cycle (C0 ± C0b) that converts raw feedstock to a cleaned silicate melt. Removes volatiles, halides, sulfates, perchlorates, organics, native metals, and sulfides. See [`docs/process-model.md`](process-model.md).

**Stage purity report** — per-stage breakdown of designated vs impurity species mass on the condensation train, sourced from `simulator.condensation.stage_purity_report()` (canonical registry in `simulator/condensation_routing.py`). Verdict thresholds: `PURE` ≥95 % designated, `MIXED` 80–95 %, `CONTAMINATED` <80 %. Exposed verbatim on the runner output's top-level `stage_purity_report` field. See [`docs/runner-output-schema.md`](runner-output-schema.md).

**StubBackend** — the always-available fallback melt backend using the builtin Ellingham/Antoine path for `auto` when AlphaMELTS is unavailable. See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**ThermoEngine** — ENKI's Python MELTS API providing first-class melt activities via compiled Objective-C/C dylibs. Required by VapoRock. Installed by `install-engines.py` (macOS arm64 only). See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**VapoRock** — silicate-melt evaporation speciation package; vapor-pressure authority for the `VAPOR_PRESSURE` kernel intent when installed. Rides ThermoEngine. Not eligible as the active `MeltBackend`; operates as a `ChemistryProvider` at the kernel level. See [`docs/melt-backends.md`](melt-backends.md).

**Viscous-flow regime** — gas transport condition where Kn ≪ 0.01 and molecules follow bulk flow toward condensers. Maintained by the 5–15 mbar pN₂ band. Prerequisite for directional vapor transport. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).

**Wall deposit** — species condensing on cold walls (upstream piping, cold spots) instead of reaching designated condenser stages; tracked per-species in `wall_deposit_kg`. SiO is the worst offender. See [`docs/concepts.md`](concepts.md).
